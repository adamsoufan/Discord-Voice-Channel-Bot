#### About The Project
When my friends and I play Among Us, some of them are on their phones. They don't have an easy way to mute themselves, so we can hear them throughout the entire round. I made this bot so I could enter a command (which I have a hotkey for) and have it mute and unmute everybody in a voice channel. 

#### Usage
In the **chat of a voice channel**, type any of these commands: 
* /m - mute entire voice channel
* /um - unmute entire voice channel
* /d - deafen entire voice channel
* /ud - undeafen entire voice channel
